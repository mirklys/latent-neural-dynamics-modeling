# Abstract

This data set contains raw data and analysis scripts used for the publication of the Dareplane platform (https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01242). 

The data contains performance benchmarks of typical experimental setups on Dareplane for aDBS which are evaluated in three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing steps and full closed-loop processing with data stored in XDF files. 

The full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS context is demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads on a patient with Parkinson’s disease receiving DBS treatment. The recordings including local field potentials (LFP - 16 channels), electrocorticography (ECoG - 4 channels), electrooculography (EOG - 4 channels) recorded from a Neuro Omega (Alpha Omega, Israel), as well as behavioral data  during the CopyDraw task (Castaño Candamil et al., 2019, IEEE).
Additional two sessions with open loop DBS are contained in this data set and also include heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) recorded with a BrainAmp ExG (Brain Products, Germany).

Finally, the set contains EEG and behavioral recordings of a c-VEP speller experiment as XDF files. The EEG data was recorded from 8 channels (Fz, T7, T8, POz, O1, Oz, O2, Iz) placed according to the 10-10 system, using a BioSemi ActiveTwo amplifier recording at 512 Hz.
