    "\n",
    "PSID stands for preferential subspace identification, a method for dynamic modeling of time-series data, while prioritizing the dynamics shared with another time-series. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given signals $y_k$ (e.g. neural signals) and $z_k$ (e.g behavior), PSID learns a dynamic model for $y_k$ while prioritizing the dynamics that are relevant to $z_k$.\n",

    "# Using PSID\n",
    "## Modeling data\n",
    "To use PSID, you first need to import the library by running:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import PSID\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can then use its main data modeling function as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "idSys = PSID.PSID(y, z, nx, n1, i);\n",
    "```\n",
    "With the following arguments:\n",
    "- `y` and `z`: Neural (e.g. LFP signal powers or spike counts) and behavioral data (e.g. joint angles, hand position, etc), respectively. Dimensions are: time x data dimension (this can be changed with an optional argument documented in the code).\n",
    "- `nx`: the total dimension of the latent state in the model.\n",
    "- `n1`: the number of latent state dimensions that are going to be dedicated to behaviorally relevant neural dynamics.\n",
    "- `i`: the subspace horizon used for modeling. There is more on the choice of `i` later in this notebook, but numbers such as 5 or 10 are typically suitable values for `i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the following output:\n",
    "- `idSys`: an object containing all the learned model parameters ($A$, $C_y$, $C_z$, etc) and some prediction, etc methods. There is more on the model structure later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the model for dimension reduction, state estimation, and decoding\n",
    "For a learned PSID model `idSys`, you can use the `predict` method to extract the latent state and predict behavior and neural activity given any new neural data as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "zPred, yPred, xPred = idSys.predict(yTest)\n",
    "```\n",
    "With the argument:\n",
    "- `yTest`: Neural activity `y` in the test data. Dimensions are: time x data dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "And outputs (all dimensions are time x data dimension):\n",
    "- `zPred`: Prediction of behavior using past neural activity at each data point.\n",
    "- `yPred`: Prediction of neural activity using past neural activity at each data point.\n",
    "- `xPred`: The latent state extarcted at each data point.\n",

Note that in general $y_k$ and $z_k$ could also be any other two signals (e.g. brain activity from two regions or even non-neural signals), but here we will refer these signals as neural activity and behavior, respectively.

There are many equivalent ways of writing a latent state model such as this one, but PSID learns the one that uses minimal number of dimensions to explain behavior as parsimoniously as possible (you can find the precise definition in the paper). Critically, PSID can learn this minimal model (with only $x_k^{(1)}$) without having to also learn the rest of the model (the $x_k^{(2)}$ part). This is the concept of prioritization and allows PSID to learn the model more accurately, while requiring fewer training samples.\n",

    "# How to pick the state dimensions `nx` and `n1`?\n",
    "`nx` determines the total dimension of the latent state and `n1` determines how many of those dimensions will be prioritizing the inclusion of behaviorally relevant neural dynamics (i.e. will be extracted using stage 1 of PSID). So the values that you would select for these hyperparameters depend on the goal of modeling and on the data. Some examples use cases are:\n",
    "- If you want to perform dimension reduction, `nx` will be your desired target dimension. For example, to reduce dimension to 2 to plot low-dimensional visualizations of neural activity, you would use `nx=2`. Now if you want to reduce dimension while preserving as much behaviorally relevant neural dynamics as possible, you would use `n1=nx`. \n",
    "- If you want to find the best fit to data overall, you can perform a grid search over values of `nx` and `n1` and pick the value that achieves the best performance metric in the training data. For example, you could pick the `nx` and `n1` pair that achieves the best cross-validated behavior decoding in an inner-cross-validation within the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to pick the horizon `i`?\n",
    "The horizon `i` does not affect the model structure and only affects the intermediate linear algebra operations that PSID performs during the learning of the model. Nevertheless, different values of `i` may have different model learning performance. `i` needs to be at least 2, but also also determines the maximum `n1` and `nx` that can be used per: \n",
    "```\n",
    "n1 <= nz * i\n",
    "nx <= ny * i\n",
    "```\n",
    "So if you have a low dimensional y or z, you typically would choose larger values for `i`, and vice versa. It is also possible to select the best performing `i` via an inner cross-validation approach similar to `nx` and `n1` above."
