This disruption leads to the emergence of abnormally persistent, prolonged, and synchronized oscillations in the beta frequency band (13-30 Hz).

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition defined by its cardinal motor symptoms, including slow movement, tremor, and rigidity. At its core, however, it is a disorder of inappropriately functioning neural circuits. The primary pathology is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, however, \textcite{kaliaParkinsonsDisease2015} [like 10 years after the publishing, get the paper from 2025] states that PD is thought to involve genetic and environmental factors albeit it still remains largely under investigation. This loss of dopamine critically disrupts communication within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops, which is a set of recurrent neural circuits essential for motor control and action selection \parencite{alexanderFunctionalArchitectureBasal1990} [maybe a newer source and phrase less superficially]. This disruption leads to the emergence of abnormally persistent, prolonged, and synchronized oscillations in the beta frequency band (13-30 Hz). Unlike the transient beta "bursts" observed in healthy brains during motor control, these sustained oscillations are directly linked to motor impairment, and their power has been strongly correlated with the severity of the motor symptoms, including akinesia and rigidity, as mentioned by \textcite{tinkhauserBetaBurstDynamics2017}.


To address the overarching goal of improving neurotherapeutics, this thesis will focus on two primary modeling challenges designed to test the limits of linear (PSID) and nonlinear (DPAD) frameworks. The first challenge is a form of "neural signal translation," aiming to predict cortical Electrocorticography (ECoG) activity using only subcortical Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings from patients with Parkinson's disease. This task serves a dual purpose. It probes the functional relationship between brain regions, leveraging the known anatomical "hyperdirect" pathway from the cortex to the STN \parencite{nambuFunctionalSignificanceCortico2002} to quantify the shared variance between these signals. It also explores the feasibility of creating "virtual sensors," which could infer rich cortical data from the existing DBS lead without requiring an additional, highly invasive ECoG grid implantation. While the original DPAD study demonstrated its superiority on primate data, its application to pathological human signals is an open question. I hypothesize that prediction will be significantly above chance and that DPAD will outperform PSID, as evidence from the broader field suggests that neural population dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear \parencite{breakspearDynamicModelsLargescale2017}.

The second challenge shifts from predicting internal neural states to decoding external, behaviorally relevant variables. This approach allows us to investigate the low-dimensional geometric structure of neural population activity, revealing how the complex activity of many neurons can be described by a simpler trajectory through a state-space that maps onto specific movements or clinical states. This scientific understanding is the foundational step towards developing a closed-loop aDBS system, where an accurate biomarker decoder guides stimulation. The motivation for aDBS is compelling; by delivering stimulation only when needed, it aims to reduce side effects, mitigate the development of therapeutic tolerance, and potentially guide neuroplastic mechanisms to restore healthier network patterns rather than simply disrupting pathological ones \parencite{kraussTechnologyDeepBrain2021}. I anticipate that both models will perform these tasks with high accuracy, but hypothesize that DPAD's ability to model nonlinear dynamics will provide a significant advantage in decoding the complex kinematics of continuous movement. By tackling these two challenges, this research will compare the utility of linear and nonlinear models and provide crucial insights into the neural code itself, directly informing the future of personalized neurotherapeutics.

\subsection{Experimental Design and Methodology}
The analytical core of this thesis involves a principled comparison of the PSID and DPAD modeling frameworks across the three primary research questions. The entire experimental workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, is managed programmatically by a pipeline script that parses version-controlled YAML configuration files. This ensures full reproducibility and facilitates the systematic execution of numerous experimental configurations. To rigorously assess the models' ability to generalize across different days, a leave-one-session-out cross-validation scheme is employed. For each fold, models are trained on data from two sessions and evaluated on the held-out third session, a process repeated such that each session serves as the test set once.

The study utilizes data from a single Parkinson's disease patient from the Dareplane project, recorded over three separate sessions during a subacute phase post-DBS implantation. These recordings provide simultaneous sixteen-channel LFP data from bilateral STN electrodes and four-channel ECoG data from a strip over the primary motor cortex, all sampled at 22 kHz. Concurrently, high-resolution hand kinematics were captured via a Wacom stylus during the CopyDraw task. The dataset's inclusion of experimental blocks with DBS ON and OFF provides the necessary contrast for investigating the neural and behavioral effects of stimulation.

The initial stage of data processing addresses the removal of high-amplitude electrical artifacts from active stimulation blocks. A template subtraction method is employed, leveraging the known stimulation frequency and provided pulse arrival times to accurately model and subtract the artifact waveform. The artifact-cleaned data are subsequently downsampled to 1000 Hz, band-pass filtered to isolate the physiological frequency range, and notch-filtered to remove power line noise. To enhance task-relevant information, a sequence of spatial filtering techniques is applied. A Common Average Reference first reduces common-mode noise, after which Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) is utilized to derive spatial filters that maximize the covariance between the neural signals and the specific target variables for each task. The utility of SPoC as a feature enhancement step will be systematically evaluated via the experimental configuration files. Finally, the continuous time-series are segmented into overlapping one-second epochs and standardized to z-scores based on the training data of each cross-validation fold.

The first research question, addressing modality translation, is investigated by training the models to predict cortical ECoG signals from subcortical LFP signals during the DBS-OFF state. The preprocessed LFP time-series serve as the model input and the ECoG time-series as the target output, with performance evaluated using the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$). The shared dynamics captured by the models' latent states are subsequently analyzed using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). CCA finds the optimal linear transformations that maximize the correlation between the learned LFP-derived latent space and the state space of the actual ECoG signals, thereby providing a quantitative measure of their representational alignment.

The second research question addresses the classification of discrete brain states, specifically distinguishing between DBS ON and OFF conditions. The models are adapted for this binary classification task by feeding their learned latent states into a logistic regression classifier, trained end-to-end. Performance is assessed using a suite of robust metrics, including the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the F1-Score, and Balanced Accuracy, chosen for their comprehensive view of classifier performance under potential class imbalance. The analysis of the learned representations will involve visualizing the latent state trajectories to reveal how the models geometrically separate the neurophysiological effects of stimulation.
The final analytical task focuses on decoding continuous motor behavior from LFP signals, with tracing speed serving as the target variable. Model performance is evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. The analysis will probe the temporal evolution of the models' latent states, correlating their trajectories with variations in movement speed. For the DPAD model, the distinct contributions of its prioritized ($\mathbf{X}^{(1)}$) and non-prioritized ($\mathbf{X}^{(2)}$) subspaces are explicitly compared by quantifying the decoding performance from each subspace individually via post-hoc linear decoders. Furthermore, Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) will be employed. Representational Dissimilarity Matrices (RDMs) will be constructed for each subspace based on behavioral conditions (e.g., high vs. low tracing speed) and their structure will be compared to an RDM derived from the behavior itself. This analysis will directly test the hypothesis that the prioritized subspace learns a geometric structure that is more congruent with the structure of the motor behavior.



\section{Experimental Design and Methodology}

The analytical core of this thesis involves a principled comparison of the PSID and DPAD modeling frameworks across three primary research questions. The entire workflow is managed programmatically to ensure reproducibility. To rigorously assess model generalization, a leave-one-session-out cross-validation scheme is employed. For each fold, models are trained on data from two sessions and evaluated on the held-out third session.

The study utilizes data from a single Parkinson's disease patient from the Dareplane project, recorded over three separate sessions. These recordings provide simultaneous 16-channel LFP data from bilateral STN electrodes and 4-channel ECoG data from the primary motor cortex. High-resolution hand kinematics were also captured during a drawing task. The dataset's inclusion of experimental blocks with DBS ON and OFF provides the necessary contrast for investigating the neural and behavioral effects of stimulation.

Data preprocessing involves several key steps. First, a template subtraction method is used to remove electrical artifacts from DBS. The data are then downsampled to 1000 Hz, band-pass filtered, and notch-filtered to remove power-line noise. To enhance task-relevant signals, a sequence of spatial filtering techniques is applied, beginning with a Common Average Reference (CAR) to reduce common-mode noise, followed by Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) to derive spatial filters. Finally, the continuous time-series are segmented into overlapping one-second epochs and standardized based on the training data of each cross-validation fold.

\subsection{RQ1: Cross-Modal Neural Prediction}
\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Research Question 1:} To what extent can computational neural modeling frameworks predict cortical ECoG activity from subcortical LFP recordings, and how well do these predictions generalize across recording sessions for a given patient?
\end{quote}

This question investigates the feasibility of "neural signal translation" by attempting to create a "virtual sensor" that can infer rich cortical data from an existing subcortical DBS lead, a concept motivated by the dense connectivity between cortex and STN \parencite{nambuFunctionalSignificanceCortico2002}. To answer this, the models will be trained to predict cortical ECoG time-series using only subcortical LFP time-series as input, focusing on data from the DBS-OFF state. The accuracy of these predictions will be quantified using the Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$). For a deeper analysis of the internal representations, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) will be employed to measure the alignment between the latent space learned by the model from LFP and the state space of the actual ECoG signals.

\subsection{RQ2: Brain State Classification}
\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Research Question 2:} How accurately can PSID and DPAD classify discrete brain states (DBS ON vs. OFF) from LFP/ECoG signals, and what do their learned latent states reveal about the neurophysiological impact of deep brain stimulation?
\end{quote}

This task assesses the models' ability to identify distinct, clinically relevant brain states based on the presence of therapeutic stimulation. The methodology involves using the latent states, learned by the models from the neural data, as features for a logistic regression classifier to perform a binary classification of the DBS ON/OFF condition. Performance will be assessed using a suite of robust metrics, including the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), the F1-Score, and Balanced Accuracy. The analysis will also involve visualizing the learned latent state trajectories for both ON and OFF conditions to examine how the models geometrically separate the neurophysiological effects of stimulation.

\subsection{RQ3: Continuous Motor Behavior Decoding}
\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Research Question 3:} How effectively can PSID and DPAD decode continuous motor behavior (tracing speed) from LFP activity, and what do their respective latent dynamics reveal about the linear vs. nonlinear neural control of movement?
\end{quote}

This final question addresses the core challenge for developing future adaptive DBS systems: decoding a relevant behavioral variable from neural activity \parencite{kraussTechnologyDeepBrain2021}. The models will be trained to decode a continuous behavioral variable—tracing speed—from LFP signals. Decoding performance will be evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual tracing speed. The analysis will focus on the models' internal representations. For the DPAD model, the distinct contributions of its prioritized ($\mathbf{x}^{(1)}$) and non-prioritized ($\mathbf{x}^{(2)}$) subspaces will be explicitly compared by quantifying the decoding performance from each subspace individually. Furthermore, Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) will be used to compare the geometric structure of the latent spaces to the structure of the behavior itself, providing insight into how well the models' internal dynamics map onto motor control.
